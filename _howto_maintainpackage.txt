python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


# Build the package
python -m build

Need a PyPI account and API token. You can test first with TestPyPI, by uploading to that instead.

# After uploading to TestPyPI, test with:
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ statisticalRL-learners

#Once setup, upload to real PYPI and do:
pip install statisticalRL-learners
